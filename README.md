# Handwriting_to_3DPrinted_Braille
This is a project that takes in a handwritten word, parses it using a neural network to letters, and prints the
braille-equivalent 3D-printed word. This is done using a Raspberry Pi that coordinates the device used to upload the
image onto the Pi and a 3D printer.

## Directories:
1. *ArchivedImages* A folder for archived images containig all contours of the letters
2. *CombinedSTL* A folder for the combined stl file generated by Print_STL.py and the gcode generated by slic3r
3. *ImagesForTesting* Testing images; not required for the project
4. *IndividualLetters* A folder for the individual letters generated by Process_Image.py using openCV; emptied afetr running the project
5. *InputImages* A folder for the image to be printed; emptied after running the project
6. *STLfiles* A folder containing the stl files used for combining braille letters; models for a-z

## Files
1. *EMNIST_Letters_CNN.ipynb* The notebook used to train and test the cnn model used to classify the handwritten letters
2. *letters_cnn_classifier.h5* A classifier for all letters and digits; 62 labels; ~88% accuracy
3. *letters_only_cnn.h5* A classifier for only the letters, no digits; ~87% accuracy
4. *Main.py* Manages all of the other scripts. It will end after the gcode has been sent to the Pi for further processing
5. *Print_STL.py* Matches all letters to stl files and combines them together side by side in the y direction
6. *Process_Image.py* Preprocesses the input image and separates letters into the IndividualLetters folder after finding contours
7. *requirements.txt* Python modules used for the project; use pip install -r Requirements.txt
8. *Send_Gcode_to_Pi.py* Used to slice the stl file into a gcode file used by the 3D printer and send that file to the Raspberry Pi; requires ssh to transmit gcode to      Pi and execute the Send_to_Printer.py file from the Pi's shell
9. *Send_to_Printer.py* Uses pyserial to send the gcode to the 3D printer using the open port on the Raspberry Pi
