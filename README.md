# Handwriting_to_3DPrinted_Braille
This is a project that takes in a handwritten word, parses it using a neural network to letters, and prints the
braille-equivalent 3D-printed word. This is done using a Raspberry Pi that coordinates the device used to upload the
image onto the Pi and a 3D printer.

# Directory/File Descriptions:
<ul>
  <li>ArchivedImages: A folder for archived images containig all contours of the letters</li>
  <li>CombinedSTL: A folder for the combined stl file generated by Print_STL.py and the gcode generated by slic3r</li>
  <li>ImagesForTesting: Testing images; not required for the project</li>
  <li>IndividualLetters: A folder for the individual letters generated by Process_Image.py using openCV; emptied afetr running the project</li>
  <li>InputImages: A folder for the image to be printed; emptied after running the project</li>
  <li>STLfiles: A folder containing the stl files used for combining braille letters; models for a-z</li>
  <li>EMNIST_Letters_CNN.ipynb: The notebook used to train and test the cnn model used to classify the handwritten letters</li>
  <li>letters_cnn_classifier.h5: A classifier for all letters and digits; 62 labels; ~88% accuracy</li>
  <li>letters_only_cnn.h5: A classifier for only the letters, no digits; ~87% accuracy</li>
  <li>Main.py: It manages all of the other scripts and provides a log printed to console after each important step. It will end after the gcode has been sent to the Pi for further processing</li>
  <li>Print_STL.py: Matches all letters to stl files and combines them together side by side in the y direction</li>
  <li>Process_Image.py: Preprocesses the input image and separates letters into the IndividualLetters folder after finding contours</li>
  <li>requirements.txt: Python modules used for the project; use pip install -r Requirements.txt</li>
  <li>Send_Gcode_to_Pi.py: Used to slice the stl file into a gcode file used by the 3D printer and send that file to the Raspberry Pi; requires ssh to transmit gcode to Pi and execute the Send_to_Printer.py file from the Pi's shell</li>
  <li>Send_to_Printer.py: Uses pyserial to send the gcode to the 3D printer using the open port on the Raspberry Pi</li>
</ul>
